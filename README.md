# Overview
A 1v1 bullet hell taking inspirations from fighting games.

My first "meaty" gameplay focused game. Made in Unity and based off an idea I sketched out during a lecture while bored. It has been in on and off development since then, and it has showed me how hard it is to make a game on the side while working.

# Lessons Learned
* File/class naming conventions are weird. I'm used to there being other developers to form a agreed upon format, but since this is a solo project I was free to do whatever. I attached "Controller" a lot to the scripts I was making, but now I'm leaning to just naming everything the object it's attached to.
* It takes me a lot to get started working. Once I get started though, I put in way more time than I expected to.
* It makes sense to outsource sections of the project that aren't fun to work on or are difficult. It just ends up taking a lot of time and puts my focus in places where I don't want to.
  * I tried doing online multiplayer through UNet, and that was pretty catastrophic. I also tried using Unity's new and old input system then pivoted to using Rewired which saved me a lot of time. I'll be importing art assets later on to.
